image linked from web/internet. alt attribute assits with SEO, helps browsers to index and to try and figure out what your website is about. with img from internet, since the image is hosted on other servers it pings that website and asks permission to use it, then it will grab it and display it on your site - your browser has to download it to display it on your site. if their servers shut down then the image wont show up because it is no longer avalable/hosted at the address that is specified at the source -->

        <p>Hi there. <br>
        I'm a Vega Graduate with a BA in Creative Brand Communication who has a passion for innovation, conceptualization and brand communication.
        I am an inquisitive, hardworking, & empathetic individual who strives to make a helpful contribution in any environment that I am thrust into. 
        I have some retail sales experience so I see the value in the relationship between companies/brands and consumers. I am competent with computers, 
        as I have a certificate in IT engineering. I would be a great addition to any working team & feel that my studies have given me a range of 
        practical capabilities that meet the needs of most creative roles.</p>
